    You see people. Opportunities.
The girl/boy you had a crush on but never had the courage to tell.
Everything you’ve ever lost. Every opportunity you didn’t take. Every moment you let slip through your fingers.
And then it hits you.
The worst things we lose are not objects.
It’s the time we wasted.
The money we never made.
The chances we never took because fear held us back.
But what if—right now—you had the chance to get it all back?
