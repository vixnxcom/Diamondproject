The girl/boy you had a crush on but never had the courage to tell.
Everything you’ve ever lost. <span className='aeon-bold text-[24px'>Every opportunity </span> you didn’t take. Every moment you let slip through your fingers.
And then it hits you.
The worst things we lose are not objects.
It’s the time we wasted.<span className='aeon-bold text-[24px'>The money </span>
 we never made. The<span className='aeon-bold text-[24px'> chances </span>
 we never took because fear held us back.
But what if—right now—you had the chance to get it all back?
