    That rice you missed out on at a wedding or birthday party because you came late.
Your favorite pair of shoes from when you were a kid—the ones your mom searched for until she got tired.
The money that "disappeared" from your bag because you trusted the wrong person.


    </div>
    <div className={`${styles.subHeadingx} mt-2`}>
  
But then, you see something that shakes you to your core.
You see the business opportunity you ignored because you thought it was too risky and people told you it wouldn't
work.
You see the money you could have made if only you had started earlier.
You see ₦3 million, ₦5 million, even ₦15 million just sitting there—money that should have been in your account by
now.
